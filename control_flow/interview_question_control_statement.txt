Q. What is the difference between for and while loop in python?
--> We should use for loop for every item which is present in a sequence and we want to perform any activity on that sequence then we should use for loop. For loop is always based on some sequence(list, range, tuple, string).

While loop is always based on some condition. As long as some condition is true then only while is going to be executed.

Repeat code for every item in sequence: for loop

Repeat code as long as some condition is true: while loop

Q. How to exit from the loop?
--> By using break statement based on some condition.

Q. How to skip some iteration inside loop?
--> By using continue statement. 

Q. When else part will be executed in loops?
--> else will be always executed if the loop block is executed without break.
